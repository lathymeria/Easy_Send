# Easy Send

Another thing I vibe-coded for my needs. 

This plugin was inspired by [Senderella](https://www.kvraudio.com/product/senderella_by_subminimal), a plugin developed by [Subliminal](https://web.archive.org/web/20070709063557/http://subminimal.org/modulr.php) a long while ago, that does not work on newer hosts.

I needed to make this for my Patcher presets. This opens up a lot of new possibilities in it, like feedback loops, or, gain reduction meters.

# Framework Used

I used a lovely framework called NIH-Plug:
